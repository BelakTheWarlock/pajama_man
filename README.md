Simple CRUD operations with a nodeJS backend.
This was a small project that I had greater ambitions for, but lost interest.
Learned some cool stuff though. Anyway, I would appreciate some critiques on my code.
I am not formally disciplined; everything here is from resources I've read.
Tips would be nice.
